# poc_dbt_oxford_brand2
this dbt project repo should be similar to the poc_dbt_oxford repo but represent a different brand (for example, rather than jaffle_shop, this one could be waffle_shop).  These two brands projects will be used to demonstrate dbt mesh.  These two projects will expose public models that can used by the dbt project and repo poc_dbt_oxford_aggregate)
